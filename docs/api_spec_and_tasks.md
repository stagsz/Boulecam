## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application. It uses all other modules."),
    ("object_recognition.py", "Implements the detect_boccia_balls and measure_distances methods. It should be done before ar_visualization.py because ARVisualization uses the output of ObjectRecognition."),
    ("ar_visualization.py", "Implements the display_ar method. It depends on object_recognition.py."),
    ("interface.py", "Implements the display_interface method. It can be done independently."),
    ("calibration.py", "Implements the calibrate method. It can be done independently."),
    ("language_support.py", "Implements the set_language method. It can be done independently.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "object_recognition.py",
    "ar_visualization.py",
    "interface.py",
    "calibration.py",
    "language_support.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'object_recognition.py' contains the core logic for detecting boccia balls and measuring distances. It uses OpenCV for image processing.
'ar_visualization.py' is responsible for creating the AR visualization. It uses ARCore/ARKit for AR capabilities.
'interface.py' is responsible for the user interface. It uses Kivy's widget library.
'calibration.py' is responsible for the calibration process. It uses OpenCV.
'language_support.py' is responsible for multi-lingual support. It uses Python's built-in gettext module.
'main.py' is the main entry point of the application. It uses all other modules.
"""

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, we need to make sure that all team members are familiar with the third-party libraries we are going to use, especially OpenCV, Kivy, ARCore, and ARKit. We also need to decide on the specific AR features we want to implement.
